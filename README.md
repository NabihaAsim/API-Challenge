# API-Challenge

WeatherPy 

In this example, you'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Weather observations

1. Latitude doesn't have a strong correlation with wind speed, humidity and cloudiness. 
2. The highest temperature is found at the equator and temperatures drop as the latitude increases or decreases.
3. Southern Hemisphere climates tend to be slightly milder than those at similar latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere.
